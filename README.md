# Coffee Machine - OOP

Welcome to the Coffee Machine project! This simple Python script emulates a coffee machine that takes orders for espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
Additionally, it responds to the commands 'report' to display the current status of ingredients and 'off' to gracefully shut down the machine, ending the script.

## Instructions

    Run the coffee_machine.py script in your Python environment.

    Follow the on-screen prompts to place your order:
        Type 'espresso' for a shot of espresso.
        Type 'latte' for a delicious latte.
        Type 'cappuccino' for a frothy cappuccino.

    Use the following commands for additional functionalities:
        Type 'report' to view the current status of ingredients.
        Type 'off' to turn off the coffee machine and end the script.

Enjoy your virtual coffee experience! ☕️
